## Personal Thoughts

This class was more tedious than difficult. I followed a routine: completing
the reading response, participating in the tutorial, and submitting the
lecture response. The final tutorial, presentation, and paper required 15â€“20 hours to complete.
Thankfully, my wonderful group made this class manageable.
