# Summer Semester 2024

## **MATH 253 - Multivariable Calculus**

- **Rating**: 10/10
- **Difficulty**: <span style={{"color": "green"}}>Easy</span>

### **General Overview**

<p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  Felt like the golden child of MATH 152 and MATH 101. Both subjects were mixed
  together to create a course on multivariable calculus, which was appropriately
  challenging and interesting. About 20% of MATH 253 was a review of vectors and
  cross/dot products.
</p>

### **Topics Covered**

- 3D coordinates and vectors
- Planes and lines
- Surface sketching
- Limits and partials
- Tangent planes and linear approximation
- Maximums and minimums
- Double integrals
- Triple integrals

### **Class Schedule**

- Three 2-hour lectures and one 1-hour lecture per week.
- Midterms were always on the 1-hour day.

### **Grading Scheme**

Two options:

1. **Webwork**: 10%  
   **Midterms (2)**: 40%  
   **Final**: 50%
2. **Webwork**: 10%  
   **Midterm (best one)**: 30%  
   **Final**: 60%

### **Personal Thoughts**

<p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  My professor was one of the best I've ever had. He provided ample practice
  questions and tests while clearly explaining concepts in class. Thanks to his
  teaching style and resources, I developed a deep understanding of the material
  and often grasped the lessons during the lectures without extra effort.
</p>

<p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  The most challenging topic was double/triple integrals. However, the tests
  were easier than the practice ones. Overall, this course was an enjoyable and
  rewarding experience.

## **APSC 262 - Technology and Society II**

- **Rating**: 7/10
- **Difficulty**: <span style={{"color": "yellow"}}>Very Easy</span>

### **General Overview**

<p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  A course on the "technological impact on society," taken to fulfill a
  requirement. Tutorials and lectures occurred twice a week. In tutorials, we
  listened to other groups present their topics and participated in discussions.
  There was significant participation required, and each lecture ended with a
  response activity.
</p>

<p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  There were no midterms or finals, but the course included a final paper and
  presentation.
</p>

### **Topics Covered**

Topics vary by year, but our tutorial presentation focused on space exploration. Some lecture topics included:

- What's the point of engineers?
- With great power comes great responsibility: ethics and morality in engineering
- Guest Speaker: Indigenous knowledge in engineering
- Guest Speaker: Engineering and law
- Economics, technology, and consumer behavior
- Social relationships and technology: Marrying a robot?
- Contextual engineering
- How science and technology influence art and society

### **Class Schedule**

- Two 1.5-hour tutorials and two 1.5-hour lectures per week.

### **Grading Scheme**

- **Participation**: 15%
- **Lecture Responses**: 7.5%
- **Tutorial Discussion Lead**: 7.5%
- **Reading Responses**: 35%
- **Term Group Project**: 35%
  - Annotated Reference List: 5%
  - Presentation: 5%
  - Final Report: 15%
- **Case Study (Individual)**: 10%

### **Personal Thoughts**

<p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  This class was more tedious than difficult. I followed a routine: completing
  the reading response, participating in the tutorial, and submitting the
  lecture response.
</p>

<p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  The final tutorial, presentation, and paper required 15–20 hours to complete.
  Thankfully, my wonderful group made this class manageable.

## **MATH 302 - Introduction to Probability**

- **Rating**: 8/10
- **Difficulty**: <span style={{"color": "orange"}}>Medium</span>

### **General Overview**

<p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  An introduction to probability and basic statistics. The course covered
  various distributions, probability density/mass functions (pdf/pmf), and
  probability bounds, with an emphasis on the law of large numbers.
</p>

### **Topics Covered**

- Sample spaces, events, axioms of probability
- Counting principles and combinatorics
- Independence and conditional probability, Bayes formula
- Discrete random variables: expectation and variance
- Continuous random variables: expectation and variance
- Joint distributions, conditional distributions
- Transformations of random variables
- Covariance and correlation
- Moment generating functions
- Chebyshev inequality
- Law of large numbers and central limit theorem

### **Class Schedule**

- Three 2-hour lectures and one 1-hour lecture per week.
- Midterms were always on the 1-hour day.

### **Grading Scheme**

- **Homework**: 15%
- **Midterm**: 35%
- **Final**: 50%

### **Personal Thoughts**

<p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  This is the perfect course if you want to become a professional gambler.
  Figuring out probabilities for casino games like roulette or card hands was
  particularly interesting.
</p>

<p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  Although some lectures were confusing, the examples and material were engaging
  and enjoyable overall. I found this to be one of the most fascinating courses
  I've taken, and I'll definitely be applying my knowledge—albeit likely to lose
  more money at the casino!
