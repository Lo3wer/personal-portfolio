## **Personal Thoughts**

  <p>
    This is the course to take if you want to become a professional gambler. 
    I think the most interesting part of this course is figuring out probabilities 
    for the casino games like roulette and card hands. 
    Although some of the lectures were a little confusing, most lectures contained a lot of cool material and had engaging examples. 
    Overall, I think this is one of the most interesting courses I have taken so far, and 
    Iâ€™ll be using the lessons I've learnt to make millions at the casino.
