## **General Overview**

    A course on the "technological impact on society," taken to fulfill a

## **Personal Thoughts**

<div style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
<p>
  This class was more tedious than difficult. I followed a routine: completing
  the reading response, participating in the tutorial, and submitting the
  lecture response. The final tutorial, presentation, and paper required 15â€“20 hours to complete.
  Thankfully, my wonderful group made this class manageable.
