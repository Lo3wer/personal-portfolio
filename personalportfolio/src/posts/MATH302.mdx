## Personal Thoughts

This is the course to take if you want to become a professional gambler.
I think the most interesting part of this course is figuring out probabilities
for the casino games like roulette and card hands.
Although some of the lectures were a little confusing, most lectures contained a lot of cool material and had engaging examples.
Overall, I think this is one of the most interesting courses I have taken so far, and
I'll be using the lessons I've learnt to make millions at the casino.
