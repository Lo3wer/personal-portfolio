- **Rating**: 10/10

## General Overview

Felt like the golden child of MATH 152 and MATH 101. Both subjects were
mixed together to create a course on multivariable calculus, which was
appropriately challenging and interesting. About 20% of MATH 253 was a
review of vectors and cross/dot products.

## Topics Covered

- 3D coordinates and vectors
- Planes and lines
- Surface sketching
- Limits and partials
- Tangent planes and linear approximation
- Maximums and minimums
- Double integrals
- Triple integrals

## Class Schedule

- Three 2-hour lectures and one 1-hour lecture per week.
- Midterms were always on the 1-hour day.

## Grading Scheme

Two options:

1. **Webwork**: 10% **Midterms (2)**: 40% **Final**: 50%
2. **Webwork**: 10% **Midterm (best one)**: 30% **Final**: 60%

## Personal Thoughts

My professor was one of the best I've ever had. He provided ample practice
questions and tests while clearly explaining concepts in class. Thanks to his
teaching style and resources, I developed a deep understanding of the material
and often grasped the lessons during the lectures without extra effort.
The most challenging topic was double/triple integrals. However, the tests
were easier than the practice ones. Overall, this course was an enjoyable and
rewarding experience.
