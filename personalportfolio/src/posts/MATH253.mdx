## **General Overview**

<div style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
  <p>
    Felt like the golden child of MATH 152 and MATH 101. Both subjects were
    mixed together to create a course on multivariable calculus, which was
    appropriately challenging and interesting. About 20% of MATH 253 was a
    review of vectors and cross/dot products.

## **Personal Thoughts**

<div style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
<p>
  My professor was one of the best I've ever had. He provided ample practice
  questions and tests while clearly explaining concepts in class. Thanks to his
  teaching style and resources, I developed a deep understanding of the material
  and often grasped the lessons during the lectures without extra effort.
</p>

<p>
  The most challenging topic was double/triple integrals. However, the tests
  were easier than the practice ones. Overall, this course was an enjoyable and
  rewarding experience.
